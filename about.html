            <h1 class="h1">Future of tranportation in African Metropolitan cities - January 2019</h1>
            <p>I will be giving a talk on the prerequisites for low-carbon and resilient cities include sound urban planning, legal frameworks that enable action, and a model of urban finance that can provide for the supply of climate-friendly infrastructures, while promoting a compact and diverse urban structure in which economic prosperity is encouraged.</p>

            <p>I will be speaking on the design of everyday things and how design thinking could forever change how you experience and interact with your physical surroundings, open your eyes to the perversity of bad design and the desirability of good design, and raise your expectations about how things should be designed.</p>
